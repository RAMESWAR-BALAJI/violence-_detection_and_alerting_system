Ensuring public safety is a fundamental aspect of maintaining social stability and protecting lives. In modern urban environments, violent crimes, road accidents, and fire hazards pose significant risks to communities, with devastating consequences if not addressed promptly. The rise in these incidents, coupled with the limitations of traditional surveillance systems, highlights the urgent need for automated solutions capable of real-time monitoring and alert generation.

Traditional CCTV-based surveillance systems rely heavily on human operators to monitor and interpret video feeds. This manual approach is not only labor-intensive but also prone to human error, especially when monitoring large-scale environments with multiple camera feeds. Delays in identifying and responding to incidents can exacerbate the damage caused, whether it be the escalation of violence, the worsening of accident outcomes, or the spread of fire hazards. These limitations have motivated researchers and practitioners to explore artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques as viable alternatives for automated surveillance.

The proposed Violence Detection and Alert System (VDAS) addresses these challenges by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze video feeds in real-time, identify public safety threats, and generate instant alerts. The system integrates three powerful models: YOLOv5 for object detection, MobileNetV2 for action classification, and ConvLSTM for temporal sequence analysis. This hybrid approach enables VDAS to detect a wide range of incidents, from physical altercations and vehicular accidents to fire-related emergencies.

Beyond detection, VDAS incorporates a GPS-based alert mechanism, providing authorities with precise location data for rapid response. The systemâ€™s adaptability allows it to be deployed in various settings, including urban streets, schools, shopping malls, and transportation hubs. By automating the process of monitoring and alerting, VDAS reduces reliance on human operators, minimizes response times, and enhances the overall effectiveness of public safety measures.
